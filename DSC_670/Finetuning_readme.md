# 🤖 Fine-Tuning an OpenAI Model for Domain-Specific Responses

### Author: Saravanan Janarthanan

## 📌 Project Objective

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune an OpenAI language model using custom data. The goal is to create a model that provides precise and structured responses to domain-specific queries — in this case, about chicken recipes.

---

## 🧠 What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning allows you to take a base large language model and retrain it slightly using your own curated dataset. This helps the model specialize in tasks or topics you care about most — like answering with a specific format, tone, or knowledge base.

---

## 📂 Dataset Preparation

The dataset is formatted in JSONL (JSON Lines), where each line represents a conversational exchange using OpenAI's role-based structure:
- **System**: Defines assistant behavior.
- **User**: Provides a sample query.
- **Assistant**: Offers the model's expected response.

### ✅ Sample Format:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You provide chicken recipes from a given list."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a recipe for chicken Meatloaf"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recipe Name: Chicken Meatloaf; Ingredients: ground chicken, onion, panko..."}
  ]
}
```

## 🛠️ Fine-Tuning Steps

### 1. **Create the JSONL File**
The file (`Chicken_receipe.jsonl`) is manually structured to contain conversation-style examples suitable for training.

### 2. **Validate JSONL Format**
Checks ensure:
- Correct roles (`system`, `user`, `assistant`)
- Required fields exist for each message
- No structural or format errors before submission

### 3. **Check Token Size**
Token size affects model training. The notebook uses OpenAI's `tiktoken` tokenizer to verify that each example stays within safe token limits.

### 4. **Upload the JSONL for Fine-Tuning**
Using the OpenAI API, the file is uploaded with:
```python
purpose="fine-tune"
```
This triggers OpenAI to process and validate the file. If successful, a file ID is returned for use in the next step.

### 5. **Start the Fine-Tuning Job**
The fine-tuning process is initiated using the file ID and a base model (like `davinci` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`), through an API call.

### 6. **Monitor Fine-Tuning Status**
Once submitted, the job status is monitored until completion. If successful, the fine-tuned model ID is returned for future use.

## 🔁 Benefits of Fine-Tuning

- **Domain Focus**: Tailor the model for specific subject areas
- **Structured Output**: Enforce response formats
- **Improved Relevance**: Train the model to prioritize specific information

## 🔚 Conclusion

Fine-tuning enhances a base LLM by teaching it how to behave in specific contexts. With a well-prepared dataset and structured JSONL formatting, the model can provide highly accurate, domain-relevant responses.

This approach is ideal for applications like:
- Chatbots with specialized knowledge
- Customer support assistants
- Recipe or medical advisors
- Legal or financial FAQ bots
