You literally just slice them in half to make them thinner. If you use whole chicken breasts\n- you\u2019ll need to finish this off in the oven to make sure that they\u2019re cooked through. But I like cutlets better in this recipe. Flour\n- salt\n- and pepper \u2013 you will dredge the chicken in flour for that lovely golden and crispy crust. Olive oil and butter \u2013 to brown the chicken I use olive oil and butter for flavor. You can even use the sundried tomato oil for extra flavor. That\u2019s free flavor there! Garlic \u2013 because it makes everything taste better! Chicken or vegetable stock \u2013 I recommend using chicken stock\n- but if all you have available is vegetable stock then that works perfectly fine.  Heavy cream and parmesan cheese \u2013 for a super creamy and flavorful sauce. Do not use single or light cream as it won\u2019t thicken the sauce very well. Chili flakes\n- dried oregano\n- and thyme \u2013 for extra flavor. Sundried tomatoes \u2013 what makes this dish so special! Fresh basil leaves \u2013 for garnish\n\nCooking Instructions:\n1.  Dredge the chicken in seasoned flour, and shake off any excess flour\n2. Transfer to a plate but do not stack the chicken as they will stick to each other\n3. In a heavy-bottomed pan on medium heat, heat the oil and melt the butter\n4. Brown the chicken on both sides until it\u2019s golden brown, transfer onto a warm plate, cover, and set aside\n5. Saute the garlic for a minute or until it\u2019s fragrant\n6. Add the chicken stock, and deglaze the pan scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon\n7. Add the heavy cream and the parmesan cheese to the skillet\n8. Allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes, then season with chili flakes and oregano\n9. Season with salt and pepper to your taste, add the sundried tomatoes then put the chicken back in the sauce and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes\n10. Marry Me Chicken is now ready! Just garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves and serve warm over pasta or rice."}]}

Prep Chicken: Use a sharp knife to make 4 (2-3 inch) deep slits across the meat side of the chicken pieces\n2. Turn over and cut another 2-3 slits on the underside\n3. In a bowl large enough to fit the chicken, combine all the ingredients listed under Tandoori Marinade\n4. Toss the chicken pieces to coat, making sure to get in the cuts and crevices (I use kitchen gloves to do this)\n5. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, up to 48 hours (the longer the better!)\n6. When ready to prepare, take out of the fridge and allow to come closer to room temperature\n7. Preheat the oven to 75\u00b0F/190\u00b0C\n8. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil\n9. Place a baking rack on the parchment or aluminum foil-lined baking sheet\n10. Lightly grease the rack with baking spray\n11. (If you don\u2019t have a rack, lightly grease the parchment paper or aluminum.) Place the leg quarters meat side up on the baking sheet/rack\n12. Reserve the excess marinade\n13. Bake for 30 minutes, flipping the pieces midway, until cooked through (165\u00b0F/73.9\u00b0C)\n14. Turn on the Broil Function to High (550\u00b0F/288\u00b0C)\n15.  Remove the chicken from the oven and flip the chicken once again so the meaty side is on top\n16. Brush/baste the remaining marinade over the chicken pieces\n17. Place back in the oven and broil for 4-5 minutes, until lightly charred (timing will depend on your oven)\n18. If not charred within 6 minutes, move your oven rack on the top shelf so it\u2019s close to the heat source\n19. Continue to broil for another 1-2 minutes\n20. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes\n21. Garnish with cilantro, serve with lemon and thinly sliced red onion."}]}
